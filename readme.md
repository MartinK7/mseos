# MSEOS - Minimal and Simple Educative Operating System

It is an experimental operating system (mostly for ARM) at a *VERY* early stage of development.

Todo:
- Boot kernel on STM32F429 discovery kit
- Build blinking app, emmbed its MEXE data in raw format in kernel
- Loads blinking app from flash to RAM and execute

In future todo:
- Process system (tasks switching etc.)
- Rootdir manager
- Device driver
- FS driver
- Some simple libraries
